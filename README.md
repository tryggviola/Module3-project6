# Module3 / Project6 / DOM Manipulation & Timing

## Project Brief
<li>Create a one page website that dose the following: </li>
<li>Use Event listeners to add interactivity in the application // Press enter to add things to the list, you can also press tab to move between inputs</li>
<li>Use a few animations made with CSS transitions // Button hover and click animation</li>
<li>Display a loading screen for a couple seconds using setTimeout // Loadingscreen when you load/refresh the page</li>
<li>Display a clock or timer on the screen  // Clock is ticking...</li>
<li>Website should be styled with CSS</li>


## The Goal

<li>Understand what is the DOM</li>
<li>Understand why the DOM is only available in browsers</li>
<li>Understand what event listeners are</li>
<li>Understand the timing functions in Javascript</li>

<li>Be able to select elements form the DOM and change them with Javascript</li>
<li>Be able to iterate through collections of DOM elements</li>
<li>Be able to add event listeners to DOM elements</li>
<li>Be able to create animations by manipulating element classes</li>
<li>Be able to create a timer for a an action</li>


## Intro

One of the Theme ideas for this project was a Supermarket list with the option to add the desired number per item which I chose to do. The project was really fun and interesting and I finally understood the power of JavaScript and how you can use it with HTML and CSS.

## The Process

I started designing the layout in <strong>Figma</strong>. I first designed with the mobile size in mind and moved up to make it more responsive (please checkout how it resizes). When I was finished I wrote the HTML code, next I moved to the functional part if it in Javascript and finally I styled everything in CSS. 

## The Journey

I found it really enjoyable seeing how JavaScript runs, the last few projects I have only been able to see the functions working in the console but seeing how everything worked on a live page was very pleasant. I struggled a bit with the JavScript code but through trial and error I got the hang of it and I am really proud of the final product. There were a lot of features that I thought were easy and basic that were actually really complex to implement so it was nice seeing it all come together. 

## Features and functions

There are a lot of features and functions that I used in JavaScript:
* I used querySelector and getElementById to get access to HTML elements from the DOM.
* setInterval for incrementing date time for the clock on the site.
* createElement and append features to add HTML elements to the DOM, for example: <td> and <tr> when you add items to your list.
* focus to reset the input fields when you have added items to the list for easier usability.
* EventListener so you listen to keystrokes for example you can use the enter button when you want to add items to the list.
* I used a thirdparty library for the first time jsPDF to export the table into PDF when you click export.
* setTimoute to fake a loader when you enter the site.

## The Conclusion

JavaScript is an amazing tool to make a stale website more interactive as well as computing data and add to the DOM. I learned alot by doing this project and I like how it works and looks. I look forward to learn more JavaScript and I am excited to use other Javascript framework libriaries like React.
